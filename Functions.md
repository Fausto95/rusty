# Functions

```rust
fn add(left: i32, right:i32) -> i32 {
    return left + right;
}

let one = add(1, 0);
let two = add(one, 1);
let three = add(two, 1);
let four = add(two, add(one, one));
```

We can name our functions anything, unless they start with numbers or known keywords.

Every function in Rust must specify the return type.
